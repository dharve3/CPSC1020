// Desc: Uses a map to display the number of occourances of a word in a given string

/* This program demonstrates the use of a std::map. When you run the
program, it will prompt you to enter a sentence. After entering the
sentence, it will output each word in the sentence along with the number
of times it appears.

NOTE: a few pieces of the program have been removed for you to figure
out and thereby learn maps. */
