// Q: What output do you expect from this code? How is the + operator overloaded in the Point class, and how does it work?
// A: The output will be: 
// Sum of points: (7, 10)

/* In the Point class, the + operator is overloaded as a member function.
It takes a Point object (p) as a parameter and returns a new Point object whose x and y coordinates 
are the sum of the corresponding coordinates of the two Point objects involved in the addition. */
