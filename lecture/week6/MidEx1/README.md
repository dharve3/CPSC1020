# MidEx1
This directory contains code examples for the provided study guide for MidEx1!

## A list of brief descriptions of each item:
1. **Public accessor**: Allows access to class members from outside the class.
2. **Private accessor**: Restricts access to class members to only within the class itself.
3. **Dot operator**: Used to access members of an object.
4. **Extraction operator (`<<`)**: Used for output stream operations, like printing to the console.
5. **Insertion operator (`>>`)**: Used for input stream operations, like taking input from the user.
6. **Scope resolution operator (`::`)**: Used to define a member of a namespace or access a member of a class that is not directly accessible.
7. **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects that defines data and behavior.
8. **Object**: An instance of a class.
9. **Instance**: Another term for an object.
10. **Instantiation**: The process of creating an object from a class.
11. **Attributes**: Data members of a class that represent the state of an object.
12. **Methods**: Functions defined within a class that operate on the object's data.
13. **Constructor**: Special member function invoked during object creation. It initializes the object.
14. **Destructor**: Special member function invoked when an object is destroyed. It releases resources acquired by the object.
15. **Default constructor**: Constructor with no parameters or with default values for parameters.
16. **Function overloading**: Defining multiple functions with the same name but with different parameters.
17. **Constructor overloading**: Defining multiple constructors within a class with different parameter lists.
18. **Type, order, and number of parameters**: Parameters define the data type, order, and number of arguments passed to a function or method.
19. **Role of `.cpp` and `.h` files**: `.cpp` files contain the implementation of class methods, while `.h` files contain class declarations.
20. **Inline function/method**: A function or method that is expanded in place during compilation to reduce function call overhead.
21. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class), hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world.
22. **Information hiding**: The principle of hiding implementation details of a class from the outside world.
23. **Class declaration**: A statement that describes the properties and behaviors of a class.
24. **Abstract data type (ADT)**: A data type defined by its behavior from the user's point of view, independent of its implementation.
25. **Mutator methods**: Methods used to modify the state of an object.
26. **Accessor methods**: Methods used to access the state of an object without modifying it.
27. **The ternary operator (`?:`)**: A conditional operator that evaluates a condition and returns one of two values depending on whether the condition is true or false.
28. **Modulo operator (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of a division operation.
29. **`iomanip` library**: Provides facilities for formatting output in C++.
30. **Role of `const` in classes**: Specifies that a member function does not modify the state of an object.
31. **`iostream` library**: Provides facilities for input and output operations in C++.
32. **`cmath` library**: Provides mathematical functions for floating-point numbers in C++.
33. **`string` library**: Provides facilities for manipulating strings in C++.
34. **Preprocessor directives**: Instructions to the compiler that start with a `#` symbol, used for including header files, defining macros, etc.
35. **Destructor operator (`delete`)**: Used to explicitly destroy dynamically allocated objects.
36. **Type casting operator**: Used to convert one data type to another.
37. **Address of operator (`&`)**: Returns the memory address of a variable.
38. **Dereference operator (`*`)**: Accesses the value pointed to by a pointer.
39. **Member access operator (`->`)**: Used to access members of an object through a pointer to that object.
40. **Purpose of compiler & linker**: Compiler translates source code into object code, and linker links object code files together to produce executable code.
41. **Source code**: Human-readable code written by programmers.
42. **Object code**: Machine-readable code produced by compiling source code.
