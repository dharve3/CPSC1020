Use your solution to the previous problem (Ch15-02-bug) and modify the transform method to do the following encryption logic:

if the character is lower case then add 5
if the character is upper case then subtract 5
otherwise add 1 (if not upper or lower)
if the modified character is a lowercase vowel (a, e, i, o or u) then subtract 2 otherwise add 3
